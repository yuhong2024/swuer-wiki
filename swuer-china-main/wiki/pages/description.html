    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>A clear and concise description of your project.</li>
      <li>25 October 2022 - WHO today released a report highlighting the first-ever "Priority fungal pathogens" list of 19 fungi that pose the greatest threat to public health. </li>
      <li>A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.
YY peptide is an effective antifungal peptide that can specifically kill pathogenic mycelium forms of Candida albicans and also plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the gut microbiota, which prevents Candida albicans from becoming dangerous disease-causing forms. We use deep time convolutional networks to accelerate the discovery of antifungal peptides[1]. Then we learn to accurately identify antifungal peptides using AFP-MLF[2]. In addition, new antifungal peptides were identified using pre-trained seq2vec and 1DCNN-BiLSTM[1]. Finally, we predict minimum inhibitory concentration of antimicrobial peptides on ESKAPEE pathogens based on AI[3].

    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</p>
